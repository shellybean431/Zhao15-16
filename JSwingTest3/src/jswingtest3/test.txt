To Marx, capitalism is no longer compatible because of the agony it causes to the majority of the people, and is to be replaced by a highly advanced social structure. The book, How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia by Hamid provides a clear picture of the social norms and economic situations under a capitalist structure. Through the journey of the main character, Hamid explores poverty and inequality, as well as the degrading social values. The depiction of rising Asia supports Marx’s understanding of social conflicts, and demonstrates the defects of capitalism and the social issues it generates.      The main character’s business experience is an epitome of Marx’s view on the evolution of capitalism. According to Marx, capitalism starts when the market has demand that feudalism could no longer suffice. The bourgeoisie propelled capitalism expansion through “constantly expanding market for its products and “constant revolutionizing the instrument of production” (Marx 17). Such an ambitious, if not presumptuous, mode of production forms an “everlasting uncertainty and agitation” (17) for the bourgeoisie in the society. This process is identical to the progression of capitalism development described by Marx. In the book, the main character’s company is established out of the city’s demand for clean water. As he attempts to enlarge his business revenue, he rapidly expands his market and adopts a modern production method. To maintain his advantage in the competition, he constructed new factories, purchased new equipment and “danced around debt” (Hamid 157), all of which cast a shade of uneasiness to his life, and eventually caused the collapse of his purified water empire. Being a typical one of the numerous entrepreneurs in the capitalist society, the main character justifies the universality of the Marxism view on capitalism development and the bourgeoisie mindset. Capitalism is merely a stage in the history, and as the “rising Asia”, or any other capitalist society, develop, it will also be incompatible with the social demand and give way to communism.      Despite his successful transformation from a proletarian to a bourgeois, the main character is constantly suffering in from class exploitation. As early as when he biked across town to deliver DVDs, the main character was exploited by the store owner since he was only earning half of the other man with a motorcycle, even though the main character’s work was more strenuous (Hamid 40). The bike and the motorcycle are, in Marxist terms, machinery that diminishes the individuality of the workers. Because of the dependence of machinery, the bourgeoisie views the works as solely attachments to the machine and therefore “the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance” (Marx 20). Later, the main character started his own business, or in Marxism terms, controlled his own means of production. As he was trying to bid for a local project, he was greatly hindered by a bureaucrat and could only resolve the issue through bribing. Marx interprets political power as the organized power of one class for oppressing another (Marx 35). Under such a political structure, free competition or free trade are merely exploitation veiled by political illusions (Marx 16). Various forms of exploitation aggrandized the gap of wealth in the society described by the book, and challenges the stability of the society, which proves Marx’s understanding of historical revolution as class struggle. The struggle of the main character demonstrates the necessity of abolishing bourgeoisie domination and creating a classless society under proletarian domination.      Subjected to the class struggle, human relationships have been degraded to a mere connection of exchange value. The main character is the only one who has had the privilege of education, while his two siblings were assigned to relieve the burden of the family through either working or marriage. Among the proletarians, the family ties are torn asunder by the need to survive; parents view their offspring as instruments of labor (Marx 31). Parents are nonchalant about the toxic working condition, the sexual abuse and the malnutrition their children undergo, because the capitalist society has reduced family to an entity of “articles of commerce” (Marx 31). At the end of the main character’s career, his former brother-in-law destroyed the business, embezzled the fund of the company, laundered the money and absconded abroad, leaving the main character with debt and a heart attack (Hamid 186). The capitalist society has purged the feudal, patriarchal and idyllic relations between human, replacing them with the only nexus of self-interest (Marx 16). The values of gratefulness and loyalty has been torn away by the everlasting desire for economic expansion. The depreciating social values supports one of Marx’s most controversial theories of abolishing family and other societal ideologies. The vice of capitalism has permeated into human nature, therefore a “radical rupture with the traditional ideas” is not only reasonable, but also necessary.      The main character was only one perspective in scrutinizing the society in a Marxist way. Should one examine Rising Asia as a whole, one would notice that the proletarians barely benefitted from the capitalist economy. The poor remained in destitution and exhaustion, turning their work into bourgeoisie capital. Hamid’s novel condensed the entire capitalist society, its boons and banes, into the world around the main character’s life, and serves as a modern example for Marx’s theory in the Communist Manifesto.                   Works CitedHamid, Mohsin.
